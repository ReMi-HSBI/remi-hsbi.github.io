    At RailCampus OWL in Minden, a consortium of universities, Fraunhofer institutes and companies is advancing technologies for
    automated rail-based mobility and researching essential underlying technologies. The focus is on automated driving, including
    sensor-based perception, approval processes, intelligent maintenance and technology demonstrations. Additionally, user acceptance
    is explored and scientific exchange is fostered. Existing projects like the driverless MONOCAB transport system and the dual-mode
    vehicle are tested and demonstrated in Minden and Extertal as part of enableATO.
