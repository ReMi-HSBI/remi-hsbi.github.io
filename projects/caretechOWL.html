    This project aims to create a comprehensive knowledge database that enhances the usability of care data
    for both humans and machines, fostering an adaptable ecosystem for ethical and legal data sharing across
    diverse healthcare stakeholders. By leveraging AI for data privacy and security and employing advanced ML
    models to simulate and predict health outcomes, IK 2 seeks to significantly improve elderly care in smart homes,
    clinical decision-making, and patient care.
