    The research training group Dataninja (Trustworthy AI for Seamless Problem Solving: Next Generation Intelligence Joins Robust Data Analysis)
    is connecting leading universities in the area of AI from the region of North Rhine-Westphalia. It is hosted at the CoR-Lab in Bielefeld.

    The aim of the project is a design-space exploration of embedded hardware platforms, which on the one hand allow the resource-efficient execution
    of spiking neural networks (SNNs), but on the other hand, also allow the possibility of adaptation (i.e., online learning). The exploration of
    neuromorphic accelerators includes reconfigurable hardware platforms (Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)) and GPU-based embedded devices (such as NVIDIA Jetson).
    The project concluded in November 2024.
