                    I am Dr. Hasina Attaullah, a dedicated and passionate researcher in the field of Computer Science with a profound focus on enhancing data privacy and security
                    in healthcare applications. I have pursued my academic journey with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Engineering from Fatima Jinnah Women University, Pakistan,
                    followed by a Master's in Computer Software Engineering from the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Pakistan. I completed my PhD in
                    Computer Science from COMSATS University, Islamabad, where I deeply explored the issue of privacy preservation in healthcare data.
                    For my doctoral thesis, I investigated "Privacy Preservation of 1:M and MSAs Based Data Sets in Static and Dynamic Data Publication." This work involved the
                    development of innovative fuzzy logic-based algorithms designed at enhancing the privacy of healthcare datasets, making significant improvements in protecting
                    sensitive information in both static and dynamic data sets.
                    Throughout my research career, I have contributed to multiple high-impact journals. A notable publication includes the paper titled "Fuzzy-Logic-Based
                    Privacy-Aware Dynamic Release of IoT-Enabled Healthcare Data," which was featured in the IEEE Internet of Things Journal.

                    Data Privacy and Security Solutions: I am committed to enhancing research that secures IoT and smart home data sets against emerging threats, ensuring robust
                    privacy and security solutions that integrate seamlessly with user-friendly technologies.
                    Machine Learning Algorithms for Activity Prediction: Enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of models that predict daily activities using IoT sensors,
                    contributing to smarter and more adaptive living environments. My future endeavors aim to bridge the gap between theoretical privacy-security frameworks and
                    their practical applications within smart homes and healthcare systems. I am dedicated to innovative solutions that not only protect privacy but also enhance
                    the functionality and accessibility of intelligent systems in everyday life.
