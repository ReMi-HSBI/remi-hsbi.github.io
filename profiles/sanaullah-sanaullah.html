                    Sanaullah's research focuses on advancing computer vision, event-based camera processing, and AI-driven automation using GPU-based embedded devices. His work emphasizes spiking neural networks (SNNs) for real-time multi-object detection, along with hybrid SNN-CNN (SC-NN) models to enhance machine learning approaches.  

                    One of his major contributions to the research community is **RAVSim**, a high-level runtime simulator that enables intuitive neural network understanding and model training without requiring coding expertise. **Officially accepted as a <a href="https://www.ni.com/de/support/downloads/tools-network/download.run-time-analysis-and-visualization-simulator--ravsim-.html?srsltid=AfmBOorRWKIoNnesV_DiTGWHin19_QPWNvS0rxAmNfexp5nx58D_sFqk#443936" target="_blank">LabVIEW</a> platform**, RAVSim is revolutionizing the way researchers and engineers experiment with SNNs.  

                    His contributions have been widely recognized, earning him the **2nd Best Award at the DataNinja Project Closing <a href="https://dataninja.nrw/?page_id=2356" target="_blank">Conference</a>** and recognition at the **Northern Lights Deep Learning (NLDL) conference**. His research bridges the gap between neuroscience-inspired computing and real-world AI applications, driving advancements in autonomous systems, smart environments, Advance Runtime Simulators, and privacy-preserving for Urban AI Applications.
